# Burmese Number Zero to Nine Classifier 🇲🇲🔢

A machine learning project for classifying **Burmese handwritten digits (၀–၉)** using Python.  
The system includes data preprocessing, visualization, training, and prediction pipelines.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project aims to recognize Burmese numerals (0 to 9) from image data.  
It is designed for educational and research purposes, especially for understanding:
- Image-based digit classification
- Data pipelines in ML
- Model training and evaluation
- Inference on unseen images

The project uses a prepared dataset stored in `data.pkl` and supports prediction on new images.
